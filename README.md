# ca-fa-rien
Ça-fa-rien is Sefaria powered and its perpose is to generate epub for ebook readers 

## Why this project ?
Carrying a book in transport is not simple.
Reading in my phone is no good for my eyes.
So I bought an ebook-reader. But there is no much document available.
A friend of mine made me discover the Sefaria project, that expose a great API.
Then I started my developpement to generate my own ebook with the content I want, and here we are !

[VIsit Ça-fa-rien and generate your own ebook with the content you want !](http://dan.sebbah.fr/ca-fa-rien/index.html?book=Judges&chapter=1#&textVersion=The_Holy_Scriptures:_A_New_Translation_(JPS_1917)##)

## How is it presented ?
First, choose your text.

## Safe print ?
Safe print is a button that transforms all Names you can't erase so that you can print and you don't have to throw your paper in a Gueniza (but please don't do that, you'll save a tree).
This feature is still in developpement, we don't treat everything yet !
