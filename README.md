# ca-fa-rien
Powered by Sefaria API, Ça-fa-rien perpose is to generate custom epub for ebook readers with the texts and comments you choose 

## Why this project ?
Carrying a book in transport is not simple.
Reading in my phone is no good for my eyes.
So I bought an ebook-reader. But there is no much document available.
A friend of mine made me discover the Sefaria project, that expose a great API.
Then I started my developpement to generate my own ebook with the content I want, and here we are !

[VIsit Ça-fa-rien and generate your own ebook with the content you want !](http://dan.sebbah.fr/ca-fa-rien/index.html?book=Judges&chapter=1#&textVersion=The_Holy_Scriptures:_A_New_Translation_(JPS_1917)##)

## How is it presented ?
First, choose your text.
Then you choose then comments you want to print
Then you can study or generate your own ebook with the button dedicated

## Safe print ?
Safe print is a button that transforms all Names you can't erase so that you can print and you don't have to throw your paper in a Gueniza (but please don't do that, you'll save a tree).
This feature is still in developpement, we don't treat everything yet !

## Known problem
I still don't know why, but with my ebook reader, the document I generate print well only if I get it from the Kobo store.
So I'll start soon to upload documents in the store.

If the ebook works as it is in your ebook reader, you're happy, but I found those work around :
1) If you add the font in the document, everything prints well except taamim
2) If you want text with taamim, you will have to convert your book in mobi (using Calibre), using the new mobi format, and suppressing all format (<u> </u> <b> </b> <strong> </strong> etc)
